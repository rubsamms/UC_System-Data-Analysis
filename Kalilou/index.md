## Project description 
Being an international student that came to the US from an international school, I remember how a key metric for deciding what college I wanted to attend was how likely are they to admit international students. Knowing this piece of information tells me whether or not I have a chance to be admitted to this specific college and whether I should even apply to the college. It is important because it allows the students to focus their effort and attention to school where they stand a chance to be admitted. In this project, I will try to determine this metric per year based on the cumulative number of admissions for international institutions when applying to UC institutions. I would then like to compare that metric over time from 2015 to 2020 and attempt to identify a trend in rates of admissions.

For this, I will be using the FR ENR_crosstab.csv file that contains data about the number of students that applied to UC institutions per high school, the city of the highschool, a breakdown of the number of applications, admissions and enrolment, and an ethnic breakdown as reported by the applicants. Note that this dataframe only shows data for one year, I will therefore have to produce more data frames that correspond to different years.

I already plotted a pie chart of the total number of admissions vs the number of denials. This pie chart was plotted using data from the 2020 year.

In the plot above, we can see that UC institutions cumulatively admit about 67% of applicants from international institutions.
